Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is

by including a 
```
Signed-off-by: your name <your e-mail>
```
line in the commit message.

It is highly recommended that you describe a plan
of your contribution, by creating an issue,
before coding it, to save you the time in case it
does not align well with the current SWARMBJECT goals,
or if modifications are needed.

By creating an issue, you agree, that the ideas described
in the issue may be implemented under the license
of the SWARMBJECT project.

# Extending the language 

## Planned features 

### Parameters with default values 

```
/*In the std::str::CString class:*/
static unsigned int length(
	unsigned char const[] string,
	unsigned int start = 0){
}

/*In some function:*/
unsigned int length = 
	std::str::CString::length("2021"); /*4*/
```

### Creating fix sized arrays 
without the new operator 

### Determining the number of elements 
in fix sized arrays 

### Refer to a previous argument with its index 

### ?: expression as if () {} else {}

### Sending an array in an async function 

### static arrays 

### constexpr member functions 

### constif statement 

```
bool constexpr compile = true;

/*In some function:*/
constif (compile){
	/*This block is compiled. */
} else {
	/*This block is ignored. */
}
```

### alock specifier 

Async function parameters with the alock 
specifier lock the pointed async object, as 
its async calls has to wait until unlocked 
when the function returns, expect when the
return calls an async function passing the 
locked object to a aexcl or alock parameter.

### Moving an async object to another thread 
or instance 

Serialization and deserialization is 
provided by the programmer.

## Unlikely features 

There are many useful features, that however 
goes against the simplicity goal of the 
SWARMBJECT project, thus unlikely to be implemented.

### Member functions with the 
same name, but different parameters 

### Class constructors with parameters 

### Member functions with 
non-pointer class parameters 

### Member functions returning 
non-pointer class types 

### Implementable operators for classes 

### Adding and substracting from pointers 

### Determining the implementation specific 
size used to store the language constructs
